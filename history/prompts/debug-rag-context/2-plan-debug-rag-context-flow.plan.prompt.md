# Implementation Plan Completed: Debug RAG Context Flow

## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary
Successfully completed the implementation planning for debugging the RAG chatbot context flow issue. The planning phase included:

- Technical context definition with language, dependencies, and constraints
- Constitution compliance check with gate assessments
- Research document identifying common RAG implementation mistakes
- Data model for key entities involved in the debugging process
- API contracts for debugging endpoints
- Quickstart guide for implementing the debugging tools
- Agent context update for Qwen

All Phase 0 and Phase 1 planning artifacts have been created and are ready for implementation.

## Next Steps
The implementation plan is ready for the task breakdown phase (`/sp.tasks`).
