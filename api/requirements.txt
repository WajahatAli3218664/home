# NOTE: Heavy ML / optional libraries (torch, transformers, sentence-transformers,
# langchain, scikit-learn, etc.) have been moved to `requirements-full.txt` to
# avoid Out Of Memory (OOM) events during Vercel builds. Install them locally
# or in a dedicated ML service with:
#
#   pip install -r api/requirements-full.txt
#
# Keep `api/requirements.txt` minimal so Vercel can install only runtime deps.
