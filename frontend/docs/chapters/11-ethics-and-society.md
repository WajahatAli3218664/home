# Chapter 11: Ethics and Society

## Introduction

As humanoid robots become more integrated into human society, addressing ethical considerations becomes critical. The development and deployment of these systems must consider their impact on individuals, communities, and society as a whole.

## Ethical Frameworks

### Robot Ethics Principles
- Beneficence: Acting in users' best interests
- Non-maleficence: Avoiding harm
- Autonomy: Respecting human agency
- Justice: Fair access and treatment

### Asimov's Laws and Modern Adaptations
- Original Three Laws of Robotics
- Modifications for modern systems
- Limitations and critiques
- Contemporary ethical frameworks

## Privacy and Data Protection

### Data Collection
- Sensory data (audio, video, tactile)
- Behavioral patterns
- Interaction logs
- Biometric information

### Data Storage and Processing
- Local vs. cloud processing
