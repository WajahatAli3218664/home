# Module 1: Foundations & Design

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers the fundamental concepts and design principles that form the foundation of humanoid robotics.

## Overview

Module 1 introduces you to the core concepts of Physical AI and how they apply to humanoid robot design. You'll learn about the principles that make embodied intelligence different from traditional AI, and how the physical form of a humanoid robot influences its capabilities and design requirements.

## What You'll Learn

- The fundamental principles of Physical AI and embodiment
- How humanoid robots are designed with human-like form factors
- The mechanics and challenges of bipedal locomotion
- The relationship between physical form and intelligent behavior

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:
1. Foundations of Physical AI - Understanding the core principles
2. Humanoid Robot Design Principles - Designing robots with human-like form
3. Locomotion and Bipedal Walking - How humanoid robots move

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will understand:
- How physical embodiment influences intelligent behavior
- The key design considerations for humanoid robots
- The biomechanical principles underlying bipedal locomotion
- The challenges and opportunities in humanoid robot design
