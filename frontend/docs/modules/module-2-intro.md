# Module 2: Perception & Control

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on how humanoid robots perceive their environment and control their movements to interact effectively with the physical world.

## Overview

Module 2 builds on the foundational concepts from Module 1, exploring how humanoid robots use sensors to perceive their environment and control systems to execute precise movements. You'll learn about the technologies that enable robots to see, hear, touch, and respond to their surroundings.

## What You'll Learn

- How robots use various sensors to perceive their environment
- The principles of robot manipulation and grasping
- Planning algorithms for robot decision-making
- Control systems that coordinate robot dynamics

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:
1. Manipulation and Grasping - How robots handle objects
2. Perception and Sensing - Sensory systems for environmental awareness
3. Planning and Decision-Making - How robots decide what to do
4. Control Systems and Dynamics - Coordinating robot movements

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will understand:
- The different types of sensors used in humanoid robots
- How robots plan and execute manipulation tasks
- The algorithms that guide robot decision-making
- How control systems manage robot dynamics and stability
