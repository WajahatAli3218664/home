# Module 3: Learning & Interaction

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module explores how humanoid robots learn from experience and interact with humans in meaningful ways.

## Overview

Module 3 focuses on the adaptive and interactive aspects of humanoid robotics. You'll learn how robots can learn from their experiences, adapt to new situations, and engage with humans in natural and intuitive ways. This module bridges the gap between mechanical function and intelligent interaction.

## What You'll Learn

- How robots use machine learning to adapt and improve
- Techniques for human-robot interaction
- Adaptive systems that respond to changing environments
- The role of learning in creating capable humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:
1. Learning and Adaptation - How robots improve through experience
2. Human-Robot Interaction - Creating natural interfaces between humans and robots

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will understand:
- Different approaches to robot learning and adaptation
- Key principles of effective human-robot interaction
- How learning algorithms improve robot capabilities over time
- The challenges and opportunities in human-robot collaboration
